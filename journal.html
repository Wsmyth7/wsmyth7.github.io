<p> Journal 1: This week I learned how to navigate the terminal of a computer and all the folders within it. I thought this was interesting because it was a new way to navigate a computer that I didn't realize existed. I had some trouble when we were trying to link all our website pages together but I was able to realize and correct the errors within my code.

	Journal 2: This week we worked on desgining our main website page. I was having trouble creating the layout of my website because I don't yet know all of the tags off the top of my head. I am currently still working to figure out what the main page of my website will look like and how to create it.

	Journal 3: When making the birthday card for my brother I thought it would be a good idea to create a transition from a baby photo of him to a photo of him from recently. When coding the eventg listeners I struggled to create the transition between the two photos and also attachg music that would play/pause on the command of an odd or even number click. After figuring that out it was simple to design the rest of the card using the basic css language we have learned so far.

	Journal 4: When making the square quilt project I came up with the idea to use photos from of New York Yankees players. I thought this idea would be cool because it would be like a miniture photo album of some of the best moments in recent Yankees history. The only problem I ran into was that some of the photo did not take up all of the space in the square but I solved this problem by making the color of the square the same as the background color, so it meshed with the rest of the webpage. This project works by using functions. I can create an input, and title it anything I want, and then give the website instructions it must follow when the function is run. This creates what is seen on the web page, aka the output.
