<p> Journal 1: This week I learned how to navigate the terminal of a computer and all the folders within it. I thought this was interesting because it was a new way to navigate a computer that I didn't realize existed. I had some trouble when we were trying to link all our website pages together but I was able to realize and correct the errors within my code.

	Journal 2: This week we worked on desgining our main website page. I was having trouble creating the layout of my website because I don't yet know all of the tags off the top of my head. I am currently still working to figure out what the main page of my website will look like and how to create it.

	Journal 3: When making the birthday card for my brother I thought it would be a good idea to create a transition from a baby photo of him to a photo of him from recently. When coding the eventg listeners I struggled to create the transition between the two photos and also attachg music that would play/pause on the command of an odd or even number click. After figuring that out it was simple to design the rest of the card using the basic css language we have learned so far.
