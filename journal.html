<p> Journal 1: This week i learned how to navigate the terminal of a computer and all the folders within it. I thought this was interesting because it was a new way to navigate a computer that I didn't realize existed. I had some trouble when we were trying to link all our website pages together but I was able to realize and correct the errors within my code.
