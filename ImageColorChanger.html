//We are adding an event listener that enables our website to track the movement of our mouse. Because it knows when our mouse is moving, we can attach certain commands to that movement. For this page, we made it so that when the webstie detects horizantal mouse movement, it divides the x coordinate by 3 and adds degress to find the color on the color wheel. This is why the color changes as the mouse moves.
